            <h2>3. Never Giveup</h2>
            <p>no matter what the situation is one should keep going,struggling but never stoping. its ok to feel tired and take a
                day
                or two off but whats not ok is to just stop there.<br>
                you might feel like irony that i'm talking about never giving up when its me who is always on the verge of giving up.
                <br>
                let me tell you something about myself.
                whenever i'am learning anything, first it goes very well,it feels like i'am super intelligent but soon enough when some
                advance
                topics start coming up my learning slope goes down and down daily.then i'am like how can i be soo dumb. i guess it
                happens
                with everyone. sometimes you feel like you know everthing but also feel like nah..i no nothing.<br>
                at that time we have two options. one is close the book, close your laptop, leave that subject and go far as
                possible.
                basically give up. and second option is think of why you started, and go back a few topics and do them again.
                at this point of my life what i understood is that its ok to not be able to understant some topics in one go or
                maybe as
                quickly as others. its completely alright to find yourself doing somthing 2 times. but what matters is your attitude
                of
                not giving up.<br>
                here are few things i do when i get stuck and subject feels too heavy:<br>
                -go back few topics and do it again
                -search for a different source, maybe youtube or someones blog
                -take a break of 1 or 2 days and come back again.
                <br>
                i hope it helps,and just want to say like dont giveup, keep going,may be slower then others but atleast you are
                moving
                forward.
            </p>

        <h2>2. Data Structure</h2>
        <p>i was learning DS as a part of my MCA syllabus and thought to write some blogs on data structure one topic at a time.
        from basic begninning to the end of difficult part. this blog is about baisc of ds<br>
        
        firslty what are data structure? they are basically arrangement or collection of data so that they can be used
        efficiently.<br>
        things to keep in ming-Arrangment and Operation and inside main memory.
        every application deals with some data, that data has to be in main memory. how can we arrange them for efficient use.
        that arrangement is called data structure.
        <br>
        array,matrices, linkedlist are physical data structure-how arranges
        they define how memory should be organized during storing of data
        <br>
        stacks,queues,trees,graph,hashing,recurrsion,sorting are logical data structure-implemented using array and linked list
        <br>
        some terms to keep in mind:
        databse-how data is organised in harddisk in some model like relational model.
        coomertial data- it can be categorized into 2 parts
        operational- which is used currently
        legacy data/old data - kept as storage somewhere so that is can be used later.
        so the large size data which is kept is called data warehouse.storing and analysing very large size data, that study is
        called big data
        <br>
        to be continued..

        <h2>1. how i made it till mark15</h2>
        <p>i got to know about neog from one of my friends social media and the first thing which came in my mind was that how
            can
            i be a part of this.how can i enter into neog camp.<br>
        
            when i got to know that addmisions will be stating soon, i got really happy but at the same time i felt like i am
            not
            deserving enough to be selected. so somewhere in my mind i rejected myself.<br>
        
            soon mark15 got anounced, i read about what we have to make and felt like donig it but again i rejected myself
            thinking
            that many others are far more better then me and they might have already completed level 0 and far more ahead then
            me.
            <br>
            few days past by still confused but then i saw stories of many other people doing it from start. and i thought that
            if
            they can why cant i do it, no matter i'll get selected or not but atleast i will get to learn new things plus i knew
            later i will regret not doing it.
            <br>
            so i once i got started there was no going back, i found myself doing it for 10+ hours straight without getting
            tired.and in no time from mark 1, i was on mark 15.
            <br>
            happpy and satisfied
